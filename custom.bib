abstract = {We study sets of directed acyclic graphs, called regular DAG languages, which are accepted by a recently introduced type of DAG automata motivated by current developments in natural language processing. We prove (or disprove) closure properties, establish pumping lemmata, characterize finite regular DAG languages, and show that “unfolding” turns regular DAG languages into regular tree languages, which implies a linear growth property and the regularity of the path languages of regular DAG languages. Further, we give polynomial decision algorithms for the emptiness and finiteness problems, and show that deterministic DAG automata can be minimized and tested for equivalence in polynomial time.}
